# tc_parse
Simple Python script to parse GCF and PTCRB Cat-M1 test cases and check the overlap of the two. The excel has to be first exported into txt file and use a tab as a separator. NB-IoT excels are not parseable without first fixing the PTCRB excel test case descriptions (they contain line feeds that break the line-by-line reading).
